## Early Rice Planting in Whole Thailand, (Mekong area)

### Overview

We used satellite imagery from Sentinal-2 and GCOM-C SGLI-NDVI operated by JAXA and ESA to oversee the shift in harvesting and planting season in Thailand. These observation shows that over the past two years harvesting and planting season shifted to the right which means that harvesting and planting season was performed later that usual.

We can see a clear difference when comparing 2019 and 2020. We can assume the changes was caused by COVID-19, a deadly virus that put the world in a pandemic. 

### Observation and Analysis

Thailand is known for exporting rice. Rice grows all over Thailand, providing food for the locals and money for the country. It is a big part of Thai culture and traditions. But when a deadly pandemic hits, what will happen?

COVID-19 struck Thailand mid-March, right before harvesting season. This caused a major rice shift, moving the harvesting season from April to May. We can see this from the graph, NDVI shows the total vegetation in an area. Therefore, when the vegetation decreases it means that crops have been taken out or harvested. There is a decrease in April for 2019 and 2021. However, the decrease happens in May for 2020. Therefore, we can assume that the harvesting season was moved later.

How does COVID-19 affect harvesting season? There could be a huge number of reasons. However, we believe that one of the main reasons is the reduce demand for rice. When the pandemic first hit Thailand, people were afraid. Thus, started preparing for it. Instead of using money and buying all the essentials. They started save money with the fear that they could possibly lose their jobs. Therefore, they started paying less for goods and services. Thus, a less demand for rice.

As you can see from the graph above, the inflation level in Thailand in 2020 was reduced by -0.85%. Which proved that everything became cheaper since people started saving money. The economy hit a regression. Farmers shifted the harvesting season for later, in hopes that people will start buying goods/ rice again. They may have done this because if they sell the rice at a cheaper price, they may lose some of their profit and may cause them to struggle. Therefore, they shifted the harvesting season. 

A big problem with this is, COVID-19 cases increased instead of decreasing, which disrupt the economy even more. We can see from the intersection of the 2019 line and the 2020 line. Farmers started planting their crops at the same time. They also planted more crops than last year. This may be because they needed more money to support their family during the pandemic since many jobs were lost. Or this may be because they didn’t harvest as much crops as they wanted to since the crops may have died.

However, they didn’t expect the pandemic to last this long, thus shifting the harvesting season once again. Instead of harvesting in October, they ended up harvesting in November which is once again one month late.

Thankfully, restrictions started to lift at the end of the 2020 and to the start of 2021. This improved the economy , as we can see from the inflation graph. The harvesting seasons went back to normal since the country was starting to opening up and everything starting to become normal once again.
